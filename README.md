# Mini Project: College Admission Form â€“ AWS S3 Hosting  

 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This mini project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3.  
The website is a College Admission Form created in HTML and deployed to an S3 bucket with public access enabled.  

The project highlights:  
- Creating an S3 bucket  
- Uploading a static website (`index.html`)  
- Applying a bucket policy for public access  
- Enabling static website hosting 
- Accessing the site via the AWS website endpoint URL  

# Steps Implemented

3. Apply Bucket Policy  
The following policy was added to allow public access to objects:  

json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "mybucky123-admission-form",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::mybucky123-admission-form/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::mybucky123-admission-form"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

5. Access Website
Used the S3 Website Endpoint:
https://mybucky123-admission-form.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

# Technologies Used
â€¢	Amazon S3 (Static Website Hosting)
â€¢	HTML5

# Live demo

# Browser Compatibility Note

During testing, the website initially worked in Microsoft Edge but not in Google Chrome.
Reason:
â€¢ Chrome cached an old version of the site
â€¢ Chrome sometimes blocks HTTP content (S3 websites donâ€™t support HTTPS)

Solution:
â€¢ Cleared cache and tested in Incognito mode
â€¢ Used the correct HTTP endpoint
â€¢ Verified metadata (Content-Type: text/html)

After these steps, the site worked in both browsers.

# Final Outcome
This project successfully demonstrates hosting a static website on AWS S3 with public access and serves as a practical example of cloud computing basics.
